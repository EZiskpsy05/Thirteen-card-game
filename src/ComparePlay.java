 * ComparePlay.java
 * 
 * Author: Howard Tran
 * Date: June 9, 2024
 * 
 * Description: 
 * This class provides methods to compare card plays in a card game. It includes functionality to:
 * - Determine if one play has a higher ranking than another
 * - Identify special plays known as "bombs"
 * - Retrieve the highest card value from a play
 * 
 * Methods:
 * - isHigherRanking(ArrayList<Card> currentPlay, ArrayList<Card> previousPlay): 
 *   Compares the current play to the previous play to determine if it has a higher ranking.
 *   - Plays must have the same number of cards to be comparable.
 *   - Single cards are compared by value.
 *   - Bombs (four-of-a-kind or double sequences) have special rules.
 *   - Non-bomb plays are compared by the highest card value.
 * 
 * - isBomb(ArrayList<Card> play): 
 *   Checks if a play is a bomb, which can be either four-of-a-kind or a sequence of six or more cards.
 * 
 * - getHighestValue(ArrayList<Card> play): 
 *   Retrieves the highest card value from a play.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Use isHigherRanking() to determine if a player's current play beats the previous play.
 * - Use isBomb() to identify special bomb plays.
 * - Use getHighestValue() to find the highest card in a given play.
